# SQLAppleStoreAppsProject
This project is focused on determining what factors influence the rating of different applestore apps the most, using SQL and Tableau. Using SQLite I was able to combine two different datasets and explore how different factors contibute to how succsessful an app is such as the description length, genre, cost, etc.
